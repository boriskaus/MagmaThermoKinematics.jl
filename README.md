Understanding how magmatic systems work is of interest to a wide range of Earth Scientists.

This easy to use and versatile package simulates the thermal evolution of magmatic systems following the intrusion of dikes and sills. It can take 2D, 2D axisymmetric and 3D geometries into account, and works on both parallel CPU's and GPU's. A finite difference discretization is employed for the energy equation, combined with semi-Lagrangian advection and tracers to track the thermal evolution of emplaced magma. Dikes are emplaced kinematically and the host rock is shifted to accommodate space for the intruding dikes/sills, in a number of ways including by using analytical models for penny-shaped cracks in elastic media. Cooling, crystallizing and latent heat effects are taken into account, and the thermal evolution of tracers can be used to simulate zircon age distributions.

Below we give a number of example scripts that show how it can be used to simulate a number of scenarios.

## 100-lines 2D example
A simple example that simulates the emplacement of dikes within the crust over a period of 10'000 years is shown below.

The code to simulate this, including visualization, is <100 lines (if we remove empty ones) and the key parts of it are shown below

```
The main routines are thus ``InjectDike(..)``, which inserts a new dike (of given dimensions and orientation) into the domain, and ``Nonlinear_Diffusion_step_2D!(...)``, which computes thermal diffusion. Variable thermal conductivity, and latent heat are all taken into account. 

If you have a multicore processor (chances are very high that you do), the code can also take advantage of that. The only thing that you have to do is start julia with multiple threads, which on linux or macOS is done with:
```
$julia --threads=8
```
You can check how many threads you are using by:
```julia
julia> Threads.nthreads()
8
```
You start the simulation with
```julia
julia> include("Example2D.jl")
```
provided that you are in the same directory as the file (check that with `pwd()`).

If you happen to have a machine with an NVIDIA graphics card build in, the code will run (substantially) faster by changing this flag:
```julia
const USE_GPU=true;
```

## 100-lines 3D example
To go from 2D to 3D, only a few minor changes to the code above are required. A movie of our example, which was computed on a laptop, is:

The result of the script are a range of VTK files, which can be visualized with the 3D software [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org). The full code example can be downloaded [here](./examples/Example3D.jl), and the paraview statefile (to reproduce the movie) is available [here](./examples/movies/Example3D_Paraview.pvsm).

## Dependencies
We rely on [ParallelStencil.jl](https://github.com/omlins/ParallelStencil.jl) for the energy solver, [GeoParams.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGeodynamics/GeoParams.jl) to define material properties (such as nonlinear conductivity, melting, etc.), [StructArrays.jl](https://github.com/JuliaArrays/StructArrays.jl) to generate an aray of tracer structures, [Random.jl](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Random/) for random number generation, [Parameters.jl](https://github.com/mauro3/Parameters.jl) to simplify setting parameters (such as specifying dike properties), [Interpolations.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMath/Interpolations.jl) to interpolate properties such as temperature from a fixed grid to tracers, and [StaticArrays.jl](https://github.com/JuliaArrays/StaticArrays.jl) for speed. All these dependencies should be installed automatically if you install `MagmaThermoKinematics.jl`.

[Plots.jl](http://docs.juliaplots.org/latest/) is employed for plotting, and [WriteVTK.jl](https://github.com/jipolanco/WriteVTK.jl) is used in the 3D example to generate `*.vtr/*.pvd` files that can be visualized with [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org). You have to add both packages yourself; they are however anyways useful to have.

If you want to apply it to a real-world system, you can use the [GeophysicalModelGenerator](https://github.com/JuliaGeodynamics/GeophysicalModelGenerator.jl) package to create a setup. We have a few examples to demonstrate his package integrates with `MTK`.

## Installation
After installing julia in the usual manner, you can add (and test) the package with 
```
julia>]
  pkg> add MagmaThermoKinematics
  pkg> test MagmaThermoKinematics
```
Dependecies such as `ParallelStencil.jl` are installed automatically.
The testing suite run above performs a large number of tests and, among others, compares the results with analytical solutions for advection/diffusion. Let us know if you encounter problems. 

If you want to run the examples and create plots, you may also want to install these packages:
```
julia>]
  pkg> add Plots
  pkg> add Makie
  pkg> add WriteVTK
```
Next, you can download one of the codes above, put it in your current directory, and start it with
```
julia> include("Example2D.jl")
```
And finally, if you have installed this package previously on your system, but want to update it to the latest version:
```
julia>]
  pkg> update MagmaThermoKinematics
```

If you are interested in running benchmark scenarios, comparing `MagmaThermoKinematics.jl`, versus codes previously used by the `Geneva` (Gregor Weber, Luca Caricchi) and `UCLA` (Oscar Lovera) research group, run this:
```
julia> include("examples/Example2D_ZASSy.jl")
```

## Ongoing development

We are working on a more general magmatic systems software as part of the [MAGMA](https://magma.uni-mainz.de) project funded by the European Research Council. That will not only include thermal diffusion solvers and kinematically emplaced dikes (as done here), but also mechanical multiphysics solvers (to compute stress and deformation rate in the system, for example). For that we follow a modular and reusable software approach, where various software componentys are are defined in external package and re-usable packages, will which ultimately make it easier to write new software and apply that to natural cases. An example is the [GeoParams.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGeodynamics/GeoParams.jl) package where material properties (e.g., density, heat capacity, thermal conductivity) are defined, that can be used by other packages (such as MagmaThermoKinematics.jl). The advantage of this approach is that such material properties only have to be defined once, and can subsequently be used in a whole range of software packages.  
If you are interested in this, have a look at [https://github.com/JuliaGeodynamics/](https://github.com/JuliaGeodynamics/).

## Benchmarking
MagmaThermoKinematics was benchmarked versus the code of the UCLA group (Oscar Lovera) and the Geneva Group (Gregor Weber). Very good agreement was found between `MTK` and the other codes as described in

- Schmitt, A.K., Sliwinski, J., Caricchi, L., Bachmann, O., Riel, N., Kaus, B.J.P., de Léon, A.C., Cornet, J., Friedrichs, B., Lovera, O., Sheldrake, T., Weber, G., 2023. Zircon age spectra to quantify magma evolution. Geosphere 19. https://doi.org/10.1130/GES02563.1

Note that quite large differences in the thermal structure can occur, depending on the assumption you make on where and how magma is intruded (underplating, central injection, injection through dikes).


## Related work
Thermal-kinematic codes such as the ones presented here have been around for some time with various degrees of sophistication (e.g., [1],[2],[3],[4],[5]). A recent effort in Julia, similar to what we do here, is described in [6].

Yet, as far as we are aware, the source code of these other packages is currently not openly available (at least not in a non-binary format), which makes it often non-straightforward to understand what is actually done inside the codes. No existing code works in 3D or can take advantage of GPUs.

The Schmitt et al. (2023) paper shows benchmarks of how `MagmaThermoKinematics` compares to other software packages. The appendix of this paper also clarifies the equations we solve and shows the impact of various parameters (such as temperature-dependent conductivity) on model results.

There are many things that can go wrong with numerical modelling, even if you use a well-benchmarked code (too low resolution, don't check timestep convergence, poor nonlinear convergence, used beyond what the software was developed for, etc. etc. - we have seen many epic failures over the years). If you want us to double-check, you can send is your manuscript before you submit.
